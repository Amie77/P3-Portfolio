                    <p>Precedent presentation is a team project from SIAT’s graphic design course. The project demands students to create presentation slides about a graphic designer of their choice by using Adobe Illustrator. Our team’s topic was Kenya
                        Hara, a Japanese graphic designer known as the art director of the Japanese retailer Muji.

                    <h3 class="subtitle">Design Process</h3>

                    <p>After researching Kenya Hara’s works and ideas, we planned on topics we were going to include and assigned each team member parts to cover. My role includes choosing typography and designing the layout. To conform to Hara’s idea of
                        emptiness in design, I decided to keep the style extremely simple. I started by sketching layouts on paper. Since the graphics we found were all light-toned and minimalist, I later realized that I have to focus on how to maintain
                        the consistency of texts and graphics. Therefore, I refined the design several times until they looked united in style. When designing slides, I tried to use as few words as possible on each slide because I didn’t want the text
                        to prevail over the graphics. Figures 7-9 are examples retrieved from our final presentation.
                    </p>

                <section>
                    <h3 class="subtitle">Challenge</h3>

                    <p>The most challenging part was organizing whitespaces, the blank areas between texts and graphics. The problem with whitespace is to find a balance point where whiteness can best support the conveyance of minimal body texts and graphics.
                        If the design cannot balance between simplicity and content, slides can look monotonous and blinding when white predominates the whole design. Texts can also be floating around if there aren’t many elements to make connections
                        between texts and graphics. After a few attempts, I decided to add colours that harmonize with the few colours in pictures in order to embellish the whiteness. These colours filled nodes and lines that fixed the problem of floating
                        texts. Simple illustrations created from outlining are also in my slides for the decoration purpose. In the end, the presentation received a B in general which I was quite happy with. However, it could do better if I spent more
                        time practicing the speech.
