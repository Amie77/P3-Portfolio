                    <p>PVS Advisor App was the final concept of our team design delivered at week 12 while taking the interactive design methods course. The course was heavily team-based as all projects required collaborations. While taking the course, I
                        was in a group of six. Each team in the class had one partner organization to work with. Based on interviews, research and iterative design processes in the past eleven weeks, we deployed our knowledge of interactive design methods
                        to solve our participant group’s problem creatively. The interactive mock-up of the app is on <a class="intext" href="https://www.figma.com/proto/VSlFqAtPqDivi2i8ucz72T/Final-concept?node-id=21%3A75&scaling=min-zoom">Figma</a>.

                    <p>My role in this project was to design the app’s user interface and prototype interactions for every interactive element. The app targets two types of users, entrepreneurial artists who are seeking advice and experienced advisors. Therefore,
                        the final design includes two interface designs, one for users and one for advisors. I was responsible for the creation of both interfaces, together with the other two teammates.

                    <p>At week 4, we gathered and analyzed the ethnographic/interview data from PVS in regard to PVS's status quo. According to these statements, we did a thematic analysis (see the image) to help us define our design focus. The problem that
                        PVS encountered was their ineffective communication with clients. The major problem was that the company doesn’t have a definite description of their services and breadth of knowledge in their online presence. Rather, information
                        about available services was concealed by personal works. As a result, potential clients could only get a vague sense of what the company does. Based on PVS’s advising service for creative artists, we aimed to create streamlined
                        communication with clients.

                        sequential art industry with tailored advice on monetizing their artistic skills by reducing confusion about managing and promoting their creative business and breaking the process down into clear steps tested by successful business
                        owners.

                    <p>When I was designing the interface for both the user’s and advisor’s side, I imagined what our persona Jennifer and the owner of PVS would expect to see on each page. To facilitate better communication, buttons and other interactive
                        elements should seamlessly guide the user to the goal. Therefore, I tried to design the interface In other words, limiting the functions and buttons and clearer instructions can lead to less confusion. Hierarchy is an important
                        aspect we considered during the design process. Bolded titles and colors are only applied to texts needed to be highlighted, leaving the screen a clean and straightforward interface. After the design is done, I added interactions
                        to the prototype model so that I could personally experiment the user journey in Figma and find issues with the interaction design.

                    <p>Our participant group feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. The owner of PVS believes that this solution aligns well with the company values and will help him reach out to other artists and be beneficial to both PVS and app users.
                        Through this project, I realized that design is not only a study of visual aesthetics but also a tool for problem solving. I also realized the significance of creating personas and user journeys. Without a definite understanding
                        of the users, UI/UX designers will design haphazardly. Learnt from this experience, I acquired a clearer understanding of the UI/UX design process and realized that every step in the process is necessary.
