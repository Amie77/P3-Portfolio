                        <p>PVS Advisor App was the final concept of our team design delivered at week 12 while taking the interactive design methods course. The course was heavily team-based as all projects required collaborations. While taking the course,
                            I was in a group of six. Each team in the class had one partner organization to work with. Based on interviews, research and iterative design processes in the past eleven weeks, we deployed our knowledge of interactive design
                            methods to solve our participant group’s problem creatively. The interactive mock-up of the app is on <a class="intext" href="https://www.figma.com/proto/VSlFqAtPqDivi2i8ucz72T/Final-concept?node-id=18%3A1&scaling=min-zoom">Figma</a>.

                    <p>The foundation of the project was to ideate a viable design focus. Essentially, a design focus defines a solution that stems from the problem we wanted to solve for PVS. Our finalized design focus was to provide entrepreneurial artists
                        in the sequential art industry with tailored advice on monetizing their artistic skills by reducing confusion about managing and promoting their creative business and breaking the process down into clear steps tested by successful
                        business owners.

                    <p>My role in this project was to design the app’s user interface and prototype interactions for every interactive element. The app targets two types of users, entrepreneurial artists who are seeking advice and experienced advisors. Therefore,
                        the final design includes two interface designs, one for users and one for advisors. I was responsible for the creation of both interfaces, together with the other two teammates.

                    <p>The project was heavily text-based, therefore, I didn’t put many images throughout the entire slides. Without images, plain text made the slide look extremely dull. Another problem about this project was the colour we chose were quite
                        bold and bright. If we abused them on every slide, the result would be noisy and messy. However, I later realized that if I only focus on the disadvantages I could solve nothing. Therefore, I tried to look at the bright side of
                        the two problems, and eventually found a solution to solve them. I used these bright colours to decorate the slide while maintaining enough whitespace to avoid making the design overwhelming. Images below are examples from our
                        design process.

                    <p>From this project, I learnt that lines and shapes can be extremely helpful when there is a lack of graphics. As a designer, I sometimes need to play with the layout and experiment with new methods to help support the communication
                        through visual. In the end, this project received a B in general but received an excellent demonstration on visual communication design.
